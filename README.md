# AI-Powered Adaptive Python Course

This is a web-based application that provides an AI-powered adaptive course for learning Python. The application is designed to be a personal tutor that adapts to the user's learning pace and style.

## Features

*   **Adaptive Learning Path:** The course is divided into phases, and the content is generated by an AI tutor based on the user's progress.
*   **Interactive Code Editor:** The application includes a code editor where users can write and execute Python code.
*   **AI-Powered Feedback:** The AI tutor provides feedback on the user's code and helps them to improve.
*   **Smart Hints:** Users can ask for hints from the AI tutor when they are stuck.
*   **Custom Analogies:** The AI tutor can generate custom analogies to explain complex concepts.
*   **Text-to-Speech:** The application can read the lesson content aloud.

## How it was built

This web application was created as a learning project to explore the capabilities of the Gemini CLI. The initial project was drafted with Gemini, and the development process was heavily assisted by the Gemini CLI for tasks such as:

*   Generating code snippets.
*   Debugging and fixing errors.
*   Implementing new features.
*   Writing documentation.

This project serves as a testament to the power of AI-assisted development and how tools like Gemini CLI can accelerate the learning and development process.
